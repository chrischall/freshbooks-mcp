/**
 * Context-group hints, published on each tool as `_meta.mint` (the mcp-host
 * context-groups contract, `mintHintSchema`). Inert data: a host that does not
 * read them sees an extra `_meta` key and nothing else. The shape is fixed by
 * the host's contract, so it is restated here rather than imported — this
 * server takes no dependency on mcp-host.
 *
 * `subject` and `when` would name THIS tool's own argument names, never values.
 * Neither is used: FreshBooks has no per-call set of the person's subjects to
 * list (the account is fixed by the credential; clients are counterparties,
 * not subjects), and the invoice list takes no date range. `aliases` are the
 * words a person says — lowercase, at most 8, each at most 40 chars.
